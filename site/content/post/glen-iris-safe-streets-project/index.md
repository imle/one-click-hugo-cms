Some money has been set aside for a rework of Glen Iris and we have an opportunity to argue that it should be done better. Safe Routes to School and many of our neighbors have expressed interest in a protected bike lane and this is directly at odds with with ATL DoT has planned for the road. Please reach out to [transit@o4wna.org](mailto:transit@o4wna.org) in order to let us know if you would like to express support the Safe Routes vision for Glen Iris!
